In this thesis, the questions are for two computational areas of   mathematics. One is how fast can matrix multiplication be computed. Second is   how quickly can a partial differential equation be solved. Of course there are   already conventional algorithms to compute them. This thesis contributes a simple   analysis of the wavelet operator as it applies to these numerical operations. </p></body></html>
