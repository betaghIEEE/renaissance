Navier Stokes
2-d and 3-d versions
Properties of fluids:  convections, turbulence, Vorticity, Thermal Buoyancy

Some external effects to be considered are : Flow around complex objects, temp gradient,...

Problems: Unstable, inaccurate, sampling data points, low resolutions only $60\times 60 \times 45$
