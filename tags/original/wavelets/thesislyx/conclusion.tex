These following items shall be accomplished by this thesis:  testing matrix multiplication and testing partial differential equations with the wavelet transform as a preconditioning function.  The hypothesis for matrix multiplication is that a sparser matrix should emerge and therefore should be easier to multiply.  In case of the partial differential equation, the hypothesis is that  a better conditioned matrix should emerge.
%\begin{enumerate}%\item Matrix Multiplication
%\item Wavelet Based Partial Differential Equation%\end{enumerate}

In order to satisfy the matrix multiplication component, a prototype shall be developed.  This prototype shall multiply two matrices together.  Several wavelet bases shall be used to condition the matrix.  The results shall be tested for their correctness.  

For the wavelet based partial differential equation, another prototype shall be developed.  This prototype shall solve the PDE within the standard implicit method to provide means of comparison.  A few wavelet basis function shall be used to test their effectiveness in solving PDE.  Also, a few multi-resolution methods shall be used to test their effectiveness.
