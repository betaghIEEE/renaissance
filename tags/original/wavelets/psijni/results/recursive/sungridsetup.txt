Welcome to the Grid Engine installation
---------------------------------------

Grid Engine qmaster host installation
-------------------------------------

Before you continue with the installation please read these hints:

   - Your terminal window should have a size of at least
     80x24 characters

   - The INTR character is often bound to the key Ctrl-C.
     The term >Ctrl-C< is used during the installation if you
     have the possibility to abort the installation

The qmaster installation procedure will take approximately 5-10 minutes.

Hit <RETURN> to continue >> 






Confirm Grid Engine default installation settings
-------------------------------------------------

The following default settings can be used for an accelerated
installation procedure:

      $SGE_ROOT          = /Network/Servers/therock.gesc.ttu.edu/Volumes/home/staff/sgeroot
      service            = sge_commd
      admin user account = sgeroot

Do you want to use these configuration parameters (y/n) [y] >> 












Verifying and setting file permissions
--------------------------------------

Did you install this version with >pkgadd< or did you already
verify and set the file permissions of your distribution (y/n) [y] >> 

We do not verify file permissions. Hit <RETURN> to continue >> 

















Making directories
------------------
creating directory: default
creating directory: default/common
creating directory: default/common/history
creating directory: default/common/local_conf
creating directory: /Network/Servers/therock.gesc.ttu.edu/Volumes/home/staff/sgeroot/default/spool/qmaster
creating directory: /Network/Servers/therock.gesc.ttu.edu/Volumes/home/staff/sgeroot/default/spool/qmaster/admin_hosts
creating directory: /Network/Servers/therock.gesc.ttu.edu/Volumes/home/staff/sgeroot/default/spool/qmaster/ckpt
creating directory: /Network/Servers/therock.gesc.ttu.edu/Volumes/home/staff/sgeroot/default/spool/qmaster/complexes
creating directory: /Network/Servers/therock.gesc.ttu.edu/Volumes/home/staff/sgeroot/default/spool/qmaster/exec_hosts

creating directory: /Network/Servers/therock.gesc.ttu.edu/Volumes/home/staff/sgeroot/default/spool/qmaster/usersets
Hit <RETURN> to continue >> 



























Select default Grid Engine hostname resolving method
----------------------------------------------------

Are all hosts of your cluster in one DNS domain? If this is
the case the hostnames

   >hostA< and >hostA.foo.com<

would be treated as equal, because the DNS domain name >foo.com<
is ignored when comparing hostnames.

Are all hosts of your cluster in a single DNS domain (y/n) [y] >> n

The domainname is not ignored when comparing hostnames.

Hit <RETURN> to continue >> 
































Grid Engine group id range
--------------------------

When jobs are started under the control of Grid Engine an additional group id
is set on platforms which do not support jobs.

This additional UNIX group id range must be unused group id's in your system.

The range must be big enough to provide enough numbers for the maximum number
of Grid Engine jobs running at a single moment on a single host. E.g. a range
like >20000-20100< means, that Grid Engine will use the group id's from
20000-20100 and thus provides a range for 101 jobs running at the same time
on a single host.

You can change at any time the group id range in your cluster configuration.

Please enter a range >> 18000-20100    

Using >18000-20100< as gid range. Hit <RETURN> to continue >> 





























Creating local configuration
----------------------------
Creating >act_qmaster< file
Adding default complexes >host< and >queue<
Adding default parallel environment (PE) for >qmake<
Adding >sge_aliases< path aliases file
Adding >qtask< qtcsh sample default request file
Adding >sge_request< default submit options file
Creating settings files for >.profile/.cshrc<

Hit <RETURN> to continue >>

Adding Grid Engine hosts
------------------------

Please now add the list of hosts, where you will later install your execution
daemons. These hosts will be also added as valid submit hosts.

Please enter a blank separated list of your execution hosts. You may
press <RETURN> if the line is getting too long. Once you are finished
simply press <RETURN> without entering a name.

You also may prepare a file with the hostnames of the machines where you plan
to install Grid Engine. This may be convenient if you are installing Grid
Engine on many hosts.

Do you want to use a file which contains the list of hosts (y/n) [n] >> y









Adding admin and submit hosts from file
---------------------------------------

Please enter the file name which contains the host list: hosts

You entered an invalid file name or the file does not exist.

Using Grid Engine
-----------------

You should now enter the command:

   source /Network/Servers/therock.gesc.ttu.edu/Volumes/home/staff/sgeroot/default/common/settings.csh

if you are a csh/tcsh user or

   # . /Network/Servers/therock.gesc.ttu.edu/Volumes/home/staff/sgeroot/default/common/settings.sh

if you are a sh/ksh user.

This will set or expand the following environment variables:

   - $SGE_ROOT    (always necessary)
   - $SGE_CELL    (if you are using a cell other than >default<)
   - $COMMD_PORT   (if you haven't added the service >sge_commd<)
   - $PATH/$path (to find the Grid Engine binaries)
   - $MANPATH     (to access the manual pages)

Hit <RETURN> to see where Grid Engine logs messages >> 



Grid Engine messages
--------------------

Grid Engine messages can be found at:

   /tmp/qmaster_messages (during qmaster startup)
   /tmp/execd_messages   (during execution daemon startup)

After startup the daemons log thier messages in their spool directories.

   Qmaster:     /Network/Servers/therock.gesc.ttu.edu/Volumes/home/staff/sgeroot/default/spool/qmaster/messages
   Exec daemon: <execd_spool_dir>/<hostname>/messages

Do you want to see previous screen about using Grid Engine again (y/n) [n] >> 









Your Grid Engine qmaster installation is now completed
------------------------------------------------------

Please now login to all hosts where you want to run an execution daemon
and start the execution host installation procedure.

If you want to run an execution daemon on this host, please do not forget
to make the execution host installation in this host as well.

All execution hosts must be administrative hosts during the installation.
All hosts which you added to the list of administrative hosts during this
installation procedure can now be installed.

You may verify your administrative hosts with the command

   # qconf -sh

and you may add new administrative hosts with the command

   # qconf -ah <hostname>
