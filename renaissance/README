Incorporated Ruzon's RGBLab code.


Matrix:
* eigenvalues and eigenvectors only work on square matrices
  why am I allowing nonsquare to be processed.
  should do an assert so it only compiles on debug mode

* consider padding

renaissance is a library of base objects to be used for research in
computer vision, computer graphics, image processing and scientific
computing.

They should be highly interchangeable.

The base types are:

Holders - templates used to build other objects
* grid.hpp - 2D data
* volume.hpp - 3D data

Numerics:
* valarray - part of STL
  slight problem in that the overloaded = doesn't work well.
* slice_iter.hpp - quick indexing into matrix
  from Stroustrap's book
* matrix.hpp - used for numerical analysis and transformations
  should work on my vectors

Image Processing:
* grayImage.hpp - handles gray images as unsigned char grids
* colorImage.hpp - handles color images as unsigned char volumes

Graphics:
* point.hpp - three dimensional point in space
* vector.hpp - three dimensional vector in space
* face.hpp - a collection of points forming a polygon
* mesh.hpp - a collection of faces forming a complex shape

Also identified, I want to add the following:
* Point3D - three dimensional double point
* Point3DH - three dimensional double point with homogeneous representation
* Point2I - two dimensional integer point - used to represents positions in image
* Point2D - two dimensional double point
* Point2DH - two dimensional double point homogeneous
* Vector2D - 
* Vector2DH -
* Vector3D - 
* Vector3DH -
* arbitrarily high dimensional constructs
* arbitrary features
